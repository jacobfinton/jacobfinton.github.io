## Origin
I was born and raised in California. I received my first computer (HP Pavilion dv6700) from my parents in March of 2008. This was just the start of my fascination with computers and technology. I used it mainly to play games with my brother. After only a month or so I got into hosting my own servers and modding games. This is my earliest memory of seeing/modifying code. This ended up being a phase (Mom was right..). That is till college where I moved to Huntington, WV to attend Marshall University and took my first computer science course. This was my reintroduction into coding and tech in general. 

## Present-Day
I am currently working towards my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My tech interests include my home lab, win32 development and vulnerability research.
